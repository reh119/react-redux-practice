Last feature i did not include was adding pictures next to books we added to our list. all else is functional. so far 
we have an app where user can add, edit, delete books. 
In the second version we will now use a outside api server so that our pics can store our books in a database. allowing the user to refresh and still have books saved. 
in the third version we will use context (centralized store) and still use the outside api
